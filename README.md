# Description

This is a place for tech lovers to share their thoughts and tech! Users can browse all the posts and comments to follow along on the site, but can create a profile and login if they want to participate in the dialogue. A user can post their thoughts about tech and interact with all of our users in one place. They can navigate to the homepage to browse posts, click on an individual post to view the comments. Each post and comment has the date and time they were posted. The user can also go to their profile to view all of their own posts, where they can interact with each if they want to edit or delete the post.

# Future Development

For future plans, I hope to add routes to edit and delete comments as well. A user can already do this with posts but not comments. I want to make a footer than can stick to the bottom of the page even with scroll and with not enough content to fill the viewport. 

Eventually I plan on adding the ability to comment on comments to further the discussion possibilities with this app.

General styling is needed as well to clean up the color and asthetic of the site.

I also want to add a feature that will label edited posts as edited.
